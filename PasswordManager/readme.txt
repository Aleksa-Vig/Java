Password manager/creator/validator all in one place?!
Source code is available in /Source as well as the neccesary .png / .txt file(s) 
in the seperate folder

///////HOW TO USE?///////////////
1. Download and compile neccesary .java files
2. This was created using intellij so I reccomend that IDE
3. run PasswordGenTester.java
4.If errors occur make sure .png/ .txt files are placed in the right directory

Once the gui is up you have the ability to..
-check the overall strength of a password against some criteria with the check password button
-generate a strong 16 char password
-access, add, and delete stored passwords!

Some more features I want to add!
-some sort of encryption on the .txt storage file
-edit passwords directly from their cells?
-Improve readability and efficeny, definetly could reduce the number of operations for some functions
-help menu
